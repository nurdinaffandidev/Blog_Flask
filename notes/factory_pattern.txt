In Flask, extensions that are designed using an application factory pattern should not initially bind their object to the application.
This is a best practice for Flask extensions, allowing them to be used with multiple applications and preventing application-specific state from being stored on the extension object.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the reasoning and how it's typically implemented:

---

### âœ… **Why Extensions Should Not Bind to the App Initially**

When using the **application factory pattern**, you delay the creation of your Flask application instance â€” which is useful for:

* Creating multiple apps with different configurations.
* Writing cleaner, more modular, and testable code.
* Avoiding circular imports.

If an extension (e.g., `SQLAlchemy`, `Mail`, `LoginManager`) is **bound to the app at import time**, it tightly couples the extension to a specific app instance, defeating the purpose of the factory pattern.

### âœ… **Best Practice: Use `init_app(app)`**

Instead of binding during object creation:

```python
# NOT recommended in factory pattern
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

Do this:

```python
# good: delay binding
db = SQLAlchemy()

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object('config.Config')

    db.init_app(app)  # bind here
    return app
```

---

### ðŸ“¦ **Common Extensions Following This Pattern**

Most Flask extensions follow this design, for example:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_mail import Mail
from flask_login import LoginManager

db = SQLAlchemy()
mail = Mail()
login_manager = LoginManager()
```

Then later, inside your factory function:

```python
def create_app(config_class=Config):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(config_class)

    db.init_app(app)
    mail.init_app(app)
    login_manager.init_app(app)

    return app
```

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Don't do this:**   | `db = SQLAlchemy(app)` at global scope                                         |
| **Do this instead:** | `db = SQLAlchemy()` and later `db.init_app(app)`                               |
| **Why?**             | Keeps extension **app-agnostic**, supports multiple apps, improves testability |
| **Pattern name**     | Application Factory Pattern                                                    |
